# Which ones to use

For all purposes the default scripts will do fine.

If you own an NVIDIA GPU, you can utilize the NVIDIA scripts to boost your rendering speeds (MAJOR factor, mine went from 40fps to 480fps, 12x speedup).

VP9 is currently experimental and not recommended.

# TODO:
Add optional CRF, bitrate, FPS and resolution control mechanisms. Might as well turn this into a Rust program.

# How to use

Make sure the video and the script file is in the same folder.

Open the script and paste in the file name. It will prompt you to press any key to close the window when it is finished. The output will be named based on the input file.
